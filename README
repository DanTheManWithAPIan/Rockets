Thanks for trying my game!

Steps for install:
1. Download ALL files in the repository
2. Run the "main.py" file with your Python interpreter
3. If the file fails to run make sure you have pygame and the random module for python installed in your interpreter.
4. Once the game is launched press "0" to begin
5. There is a point counter in the bottom right, destroy as many space rocks as you can!
6. If a rock hits you the game ends and each rock destoryed is 1 point.

Commands for the game are as follows:
Arrow up - Moves Rocket ship up
Arrow down - Moves Rocket ship down
Arrow left - Moves Rocket ship left
Arrow right - Moves Rocket ship right
Spacebar - Shoots a laser
"0" Key above O and P is to start the game

I plan on updating the game until I run out of ideas.
